Problem Statement



There is need to create mobile applications to improve educational experience so as to gainfully engage the students. 
Though there have been reactions with the use of mobile devices in the classroom. 
This one promises to be a silent application that will not distract students while in the classroom receiving lectures. 
The problem with our educational system mostly lies in the area of lack of proper communication. 
From my experience as a Student and a Lecturer in the higher institution, the problems this project aims to mitigate are as follows:
1.	Insufficient communication between students and lecturers after class sessions. The only time a lecturer can meet with all the students is only during lecture hours.
2.	Inability of the lecturers to always cover the scheme of work before the examination period.
3.	Lack of adequate mobile application to support distance learning.
